        I've always had the impression that I'm not the kind of person that
        joins in most of the activities my friends do, which has made me unique
        in every way. I always try to find a purpose in everything I set out to
        achieve, and I absorb lessons from the mistakes of others as long as
        they will help me progress. <br />
        <br />
        When I learned about software development, I focused all of my attention
        on learning how it functions because I was so eager to learn more about
        it. My excitement and desire to learn more grew as I became more
        familiar with some programming languages. <br />
        <br />
        When ever I remember that I'm a coder, I always feel great, especially
        when I'm tackling an issue that exists in the real world, My love for
        technology inspired me to set the aim of always doing my best to make an
        impact wherever I find myself. <br />
        <br />
        At first, I believed that coding was only for the most intelligent
        people, but I later came to understand that it was a game that everyone
        who had the right mindset, focus, and interest could play.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although there is a saying that goes, "What your friends are doing, do
        as they do," I don't adhere to it; instead, as long as I'm on the proper
        route, I follow my own paths.
