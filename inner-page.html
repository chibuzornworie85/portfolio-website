      I've always had the impression that I'm not the kind of person that
      joins in most of the activities my friends do, which has made me unique
      in every way. I always try to find a purpose in everything I set out to
      achieve, and I absorb lessons from the mistakes of others as long as
      they will help me progress. <br />
      <br />
      When I learned about software development, I focused all of my attention
      on learning how it functions because I was so eager to learn more about
      it. My excitement and desire to learn more grew as I became more
      familiar with some programming languages. <br />
      <br />
      When ever I remember that I'm a coder, I always feel great, especially
      when I'm tackling an issue that exists in the real world, My love for
      technology inspired me to set the aim of always doing my best to make an
      impact wherever I find myself. <br />
      <br />
      At first, I believed that coding was only for the most intelligent
      people, but I later came to understand that it was a game that everyone
      who had the right mindset, focus, and interest could play.
      <br />
      <br />
      Although there is a saying that goes, "What your friends are doing, do
      as they do," I don't adhere to it; instead, as long as I'm on the proper
      route, I follow my own paths.
